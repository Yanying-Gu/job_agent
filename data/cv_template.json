An intelligent, automated solution was required to improve efficiency and support growth. Action: Led the end-to-end design of a scalable ML decision engine on AWS SageMaker, translating business needs into production-ready models with full lifecycle coverage. Result: The solution was deployed in 6 countries and automated 50% of maintenance approvals, significantly reducing delays, lowering costs, and enhancing system scalability."

Action: Redesigned the ML workflow by migrating ETL to Snowflake with Snowpark, replacing Airflow with SageMaker Pipelines, and automating deployment via GitLab CI/CD. Result: Delivered a robust ML platform with unified data processing, streamlined CI/CD, and significantly reduced time-to-deploy and increased team efficiency."

I managed cross-functional teams to ensure smooth execution.

The solution automated pricing based on vehicle and market data, with built-in monitoring and retraining, and was fully integrated into business operations. Result: Now live in 23 countries, the system prices over 15,000 vehicles monthly, reducing manual work by 60% and significantly improving speed and accuracy."

Action: Starting from a business use case, I led the development of a proof of concept and scaled it into a full production-grade E2E ML solution. This included building data and ML pipelines, deploying a daily batch inference pipeline, and integrating it into the maintenance system—along with implementing monitoring and alerting to ensure production reliability. Result: The solution now delivers weekly mileage predictions for ~5 million vehicles with approximately 10% MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). This significantly improved the accuracy of maintenance planning, enabling timely interventions, reducing unplanned downtime, and enhancing overall fleet safety and operational efficiency."
